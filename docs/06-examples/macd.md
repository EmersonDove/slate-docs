# MACD

## Today’s Model

Today we’re going to build a trading algorithm that utilizes the [Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) to invest in crypto on Coinbase Pro. This is a relatively straightforward algorithm, so let’s get right into it! 

## Understanding the MACD

The MACD takes two moving averages at different time frames and essentially provides a signal that looks at the “spread” between the two moving averages. As the two moving averages spread wider (i.e. diverge), then we look to a certain action, when they become equal (i.e. converge), then we look to do a specific action. Thus we can see that the MACD is calculated as the difference between two specific moving averages. The two moving averages that are typically chosen are the 12 and 26 EMA. In addition, a 9-day EMA **on the MACD** is used as the “signal” to determine when we want to buy or sell (similar to the golden cross). By utilizing this signal, we’re able to detect when we cross up on the signal (for a buy), and when we cross down on the signal (signaling a sell).

As you can see from this graph above: we are buying when the 9-day EMA hits the MACD line, and selling when it crosses below the 9-day EMA. In addition, the divergence and convergence of the MACD is plotted via the histogram-like plot below. This can help signify how bullish and how bearish a current trend is along with if it might be ending. 

## Overview

In order to put this into practice, we will first initialize our environment. As we mentioned before, we are running this on Coinbase Pro, so we will need to get all the keys set up in order to move forward and accurately run a backtest.

Here’s the link to how to get your [Coinbase Keys](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/other-topics/api/how-do-i-create-an-api-key-for-coinbase-pro), we’ll plug these right into the CLI

## Initialize Environment

### Initializing without the Blankly Platform

To initialize our environment for Coinbase using `blankly` all we have to do is install it and run `blankly init`  in our directory. 

```jsx
$ pip install -U blankly
$ blankly init # (Walking through the steps of adding Coinbase Pro Keys)
```

And awesome! We’ve now initialized our directory with all of our files. To see more information about what’s going on here, you can see more [here](https://docs.blankly.finance/getting-started/your-first-algorithm#setting-up-your-environment-with-blankly) and [here for CLI](https://docs.blankly.finance/getting-started/tutorial)

Following the prompts, we should now be completely set up! 

### Initializing with the Blankly Platform

The Blankly Platform enables you to have a wider access of more metrics, visualizations, and features along with the storage of your previous backtests all over time. It also allows you to deploy your model live to production in literally seconds. Now all we have to do is alter our step above and do: 

```bash
$ pip install -U blankly
$ blankly login # (This will take you to the platform)
$ blankly init
```

Once you’re logged in, you can finish the set up and creation of your first model via `blankly init` and selecting “Yes I want to connect to the platform”. 

## Quick Overview of Directory

Blankly directories are divided into a few parts:

![Current Directory](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/blankly-6ada5.appspot.com/o/blog%2Fimages%2FMACD-bot%2FUntitled%201.png?alt=media&token=a50e533b-d08e-458b-9049-9721fb6559ad)

This includes a `keys.json` that houses all of your keys across exchanges, a `backtest.json` that allows you to configure backtest details including benchmarks etc., a `settings.json` for various settings (such as backtest on close, enabling shorting, etc.) and a `blankly.json` that communicates with Blankly Slate. And of course you have your script the [`bot.py`](http://bot.py) which is a templated RSI model. 

## Diving into the Code

To get started, we’re going to go into the `[bot.py](http://bot.py)` and replace the code with this initial boilerplate

```bash
from blankly import Strategy, StrategyState, Interface, trunc
from blankly import CoinbasePro
from blankly.indicators import macd

def init(symbol, state: StrategyState):
    # run on a new price event to initialize variables
    pass

def price_event(price, symbol, state: StrategyState):
    # we'll come back to this soon
    pass

cbpro = CoinbasePro()
s = Strategy(cbpro)
s.add_price_event(price_event, 'BTC-USD', resolution='30m', init=init)
s.start()
```

As you can see here, blankly divides up a `Strategy` into a price event, an initialization function, and an exchange. This allows you to add as many price events as you like at varying resolutions.

Our `price_event` will house our main trading logic while our `init` will house all the logic required to set items up including our variables, previous history, and whether or not we have a position.

### The `init` function

In order to speed things up, we should make one call to get the historical data that we need and append data as new prices come in. We also need to initialize some variabels for the price event.

We can actually easily do this on initialization and make sure the proper data is passed in to the proper price events:

```python
SHORT_PERIOD = 12
LONG_PERIOD = 26
SIGNAL_PERIOD = 9

def init(symbol, state: StrategyState):
    interface: Interface = state.interface
    variables = state.variables
    # initialize the historical data
    variables['history'] = interface.history(symbol, 400, 
        resolution,
        return_as='deque')['close']
    variables['has_bought'] = False
```

Using the `init` we’re able to gather our historical data and store that into a deque (a fixed size list) so that we don’t go over in memory. We also initialize a variable of whether or not we have a position to false (so we don’t buy when we already have a position). 

Now, we can move on to our `price_event` . You can also see that we initialized three variables in the `global` namespaces so any function including our `price_event` can access them. 

### The Price Event

Our price event as you can see now does the majority of the logic. It’s the one that’s actually going out to calculate the MACD, and determine the signals. First, we’re going to ensure that our history is up to date by appending the new price. Then we’re going to calculate the MACD on top of our history using our `SHORT_PERIOD` , `LONG_PERIOD` and `SIGNAL_PERIOD` . Then we’ll calculate the slope to determine positive and negative (i.e. cross-up or cross-down), and then we’ll go ahead and buy if it’s a cross-up and sell if it’s a cross-down. Notice that we change the `has_bought` every time. We also use `trunc` to avoid floating point errors and overflow. 

```python
 def price_event(price, symbol, state: StrategyState):
    interface: Interface = state.interface
    # allow the resolution to be any resolution: 15m, 30m, 1d, etc.
    variables = state.variables

    variables['history'].append(price)
    macd_res, macd_signal, macd_histogram = macd(variables['history'], 
                                                 short_period=SHORT_PERIOD,
                                                 long_period=LONG_PERIOD,
                                                 signal_period=SIGNAL_PERIOD)

    slope_macd = (macd_res[-1] - macd_res[-5]) / 5  # get the slope of the last 5 MACD_points
    prev_macd = macd_res[-2]
    curr_macd = macd_res[-1]
    curr_signal_macd = macd_signal[-1]

    # We want to make sure this works even if curr_macd does not equal the signal MACD
    is_cross_up = slope_macd > 0 and curr_macd >= curr_signal_macd > prev_macd

    is_cross_down = slope_macd < 0 and curr_macd <= curr_signal_macd < prev_macd
    if is_cross_up and not variables['has_bought']:
        # buy with all available cash
        interface.market_order(symbol, 'buy', trunc(interface.cash/price, 5))
        variables['has_bought'] = True
    elif is_cross_down and variables['has_bought']:
        # sell all of the position
        interface.market_order(symbol, 'sell', trunc(interface.account[symbol].available, 5))
        variables['has_bought'] = False
```

## Putting it All Together

Putting this all together, we get our final result and overall code! Now we used Coinbase Pro in this example, but Blankly also supports OANDA for Forex, Alpaca for Stocks, and many other crypto exchanges including FTX, Binance, and Kucoin as well. Check out some [Common Gotchas](https://docs.blankly.finance/getting-started/common-gotchas) between switching exchanges.

```python
from blankly import Strategy, StrategyState, Interface, trunc
from blankly import CoinbasePro
from blankly.indicators import macd

SHORT_PERIOD = 12
LONG_PERIOD = 26
SIGNAL_PERIOD = 9

def init(symbol, state: StrategyState):
    interface: Interface = state.interface
    variables = state.variables
    # initialize the historical data
    variables['history'] = interface.history(symbol, 400, 
        resolution,
        return_as='deque')['close']
    variables['has_bought'] = False

def price_event(price, symbol, state: StrategyState):
    interface: Interface = state.interface
    # allow the resolution to be any resolution: 15m, 30m, 1d, etc.
    variables = state.variables

    variables['history'].append(price)
    macd_res, macd_signal, macd_histogram = macd(variables['history'], 
                                                 short_period=SHORT_PERIOD,
                                                 long_period=LONG_PERIOD,
                                                 signal_period=SIGNAL_PERIOD)

    slope_macd = (macd_res[-1] - macd_res[-5]) / 5  # get the slope of the last 5 MACD_points
    prev_macd = macd_res[-2]
    curr_macd = macd_res[-1]
    curr_signal_macd = macd_signal[-1]

    # We want to make sure this works even if curr_macd does not equal the signal MACD
    is_cross_up = slope_macd > 0 and curr_macd >= curr_signal_macd > prev_macd

    is_cross_down = slope_macd < 0 and curr_macd <= curr_signal_macd < prev_macd
    if is_cross_up and not variables['has_bought']:
        # buy with all available cash
        interface.market_order(symbol, 'buy', trunc(interface.cash/price, 5))
        variables['has_bought'] = True
    elif is_cross_down and variables['has_bought']:
        # sell all of the position
        interface.market_order(symbol, 'sell', trunc(interface.account[symbol].available, 5))
        variables['has_bought'] = False

cbpro = CoinbasePro()
s = Strategy(cbpro)
s.add_price_event(price_event, 'BTC-USD', resolution='1d', init=init)
s.backtest('1y', initial_values={'USD': 10000})
```

## Conclusion

This was a Crypto MACD Bot. Some next steps would be to look at using the [Kelly Criterion](https://blankly.finance/the-kelly-criterion) to optimize your cash allocation towards this specific algorithm. You can also try experimenting with various periods to improve your odds and attempt to run this on multiple price events! 

Some major limitations of MACD, however, is that the signals (depending on your time frame) are far and few between and typically aren’t indicative of how **strong** a trend is. You also need to consider things such as stop losses and when to take profit! There's also the issue with fees! The shorter your time interval, the more you will battle with intervals.
