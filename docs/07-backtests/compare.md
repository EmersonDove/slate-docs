Note: you must select at least 2 backtests (up to 8 backtests).  

#### Through a Backtest
You can also open up the comparison configuration with a pre-selected backtest.
To do this, click the three dots on the right side of any backtest and select **Compare This Backtest**.
This will open up the comparison configuration with the backtest already selected.
