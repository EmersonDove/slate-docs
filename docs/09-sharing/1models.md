# Sharing Models

You can easily share your past, paper, and or live trading models with others to compare and monitor the results in real-time. We handle the fetching of data, calculationg of live metrics all for you. This allows you to send the model to viewers who may want to see model performance. We also offer the ability to easily share or embed your models into other articles and websites via `iframe` embeds. Please reference the embed section for more details regaurding embedables. 

## Sharing the Model

To share an individual model, click on the **Share** Button to the right of the Nav. From there you are able to select whether or no you want to generate a preview link and / or generate and embed link. Easily switching them on and off will allow you to share and embed the model wherever you like.

Then, feel free to send the link to your co-workers, friends, or whoever you choose.

If you ever feel like your model doing a bit *too good*, feel free to toggle the preview model to off and no-one will be able to see your model again, even those with the link.
