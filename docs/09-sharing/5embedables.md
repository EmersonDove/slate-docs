## Errors

If your embed is not working, we also include a couple of error messages that can be displayed instead of your actual embeds. Here are their solutions.

| Error Type                | Reason                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Invalid Credentials       | One of the IDs that you have provided is incorrect and does not correspond with any of the preexisting IDs in our database. Make sure to double check your IDS and ensure that you did not mistype or miscopy an ID. Also esure that you are **not** including braces [] in your URL query. |
| Invalid Share Permissions | The model or backtest you are trying to embed does not have the proper share permissions enabled. Make sure that the sharable preview options is toggled on first and try again. This change may take a moment to propatate through. |
