# Sharing Backtests

Backtests are often used to determine whether or not a trading strategy is profitable or not from an initial look. It involves looking at a multitude of different metrics and comparing them to different models. As a result, it is a very collaborative process. We offer the ability to easily share backtests or embed backtests into other articles and websites via `iframe` embeds. 

:::note
When you share a backtest, you also share the entire model results / performance (this includes live) for viewing

## Sharing the Backtest

To share an individual backtest, click on the **Share Button** that is right above the account value graphs. The Share Button provides a link that shows a preview of the backtest and can be shared over the internet and social media. 
## Embedding the Backtest

You also have the option to embed the backtest result by clicking the **Embed Result** button where you have multiple options to showcase just the account value graphs, the metrics, or both.
